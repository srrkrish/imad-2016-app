This is a utility designed and developed by the Officers of the Core Banking Project at C D C Belapur.  The intention of providing this site is to give you some additional inputs which could be of use for the branches and is not available from the Core Banking software as such.  We have tried our best to accommodate the requirements of the branch based
      on our own experience in the branches.  It is however, still possible that the site can be improved and we welcome your suggestions to improve the same. Your suggestions may be inserted into the space provided here in this page. We highlight below some of the utilities available and how to go about it.</div></font></td>

How to rectify the GLIF differences:</font></p>

<div align="left">

<table border="0" width="500">

    <td width="12%" valign="top"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">
Cash Account:</font></td>
    <td width="88%"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
    <div align="justify">
The figures under the day’s differences are underlined.  They are linked to various reports. For example in your branch if you find a difference in the Day’s difference under the Cash GLIF, click on it and you get the complete Cash Scroll of the branch as available at CDC.  Where ever we have found two transactions for the same amount in the same account the same has been highlighted.  Where ever transactions are there in the Cash Rectification Account has been highlighted in a different colour and those for transactions between Vault Teller and Cash Officer and Vice Versa have also been shaded.  All you have to do is to verify the transactions with your branch manual cash scroll and locate for the difference.  The most probable errors that we have come across are two debits/credits in an account against one payment/receipt.  Non updation of the account though the Cash drawer has been updated.  Based on this, there are only two things to do for rectification – either an account has to be debited or it has to be credited.  The rectification option is available in the following navigation:<br>
Branch Accounting (BGL)&nbsp; -&gt; Cash BGL rectification -&gt; 1. Debit Deposit. 2. Credit Deposit 3.Debit CC/OD. 4. Credit CC/OD. 5.Debit Loan. 6. Credit Loan.
7. Debit BGL 8. Credit BGL.
</div>      
    <div align="justify">
Depending on which account has to be credited/debited, the relative menu may be used.&nbsp;<br>
However, the CDC is sending the cash report every day at 2.30,4.30,6.30 and 8.30 PM.  The branches before closing their cash account may verify with this report and rectify the same on the same day itself.<br>
</div>      </font><hr></td>
  </tr>

    <td width="12%" valign="top" ><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#FF00FF">
Transfer GLIF</font></td>
    <td width="88%" ><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">    <div align="justify">

Similar to the entries in the Cash account, here also the day’s difference is underlined.  Clicking on this gives the branches a clue as to a batch failure and which entry has not been posted and posted more than once.  Entries not posted in the trickle feed are also given separately as you click on the difference.  Please note that if the day’s difference is showing a (-) sign, then some account has to be credited and if there is no sign then some account has to be debited.<br>
Please note that old entries were crystallized and parked in account no.1260505003.  The amount outstanding in this account will be treated as ‘over 90 days’ for the purpose of NPA classification and will attract provisioning.  Branches should therefore make earnest effort to clear off all these entries.  Needless to repeat the entries lying in 1260505001 should be attacked on a day to day basis and never allowed to accumulate.<br>
The rectification for the transfer GLIF is almost similar to that of the Cash GLIF except that one additional field for the date column is provided.  Care has to be taken to enter the date correctly.  The system does not validate the date or the account number and it is based on the date that the system rectifies the entries in the Transfer GLIF old or new.<br>

For the benefit of the branches, the WSA that is available in CORE has been simplified and made as a one page WSA.  The branches may take a printout and file it.  Please go through the WSA and entries found with a (-) sign needs your urgent attention.  The entries come in this sign when an asset based account has gone to credit balance or vice versa.  The reason for this should be analysed and rectified without which the Balance Sheet will also not tally.<br>
Branch Suspense Account (A 30 G in WSA)<br>
The balance outstanding in this account should normally be the sum total of account numbers 1111111111, 1111111112,1260505001,1260505003(all available in the GLCNTR) report and 2148505001 (balance outstanding under the report ‘List of non-zero intermediary/suspense account).  This should normally be zero except of course the balance in OLRR dishonour account which would be reversed only on the next day after the clearing is over.  By clicking on the Option Branch Suspense the branches can see if any other entry has come up.  Steps should be taken by the branches to ensure that this is rectified because due to some wrong accounting an account which should have got the correct credit/debit would not have got it.&nbsp;<br>
IBIT/Sundry/Suspense outstanding:<br>
This utility enables the branch to monitor the outstandings in IBIT/Sundry/Suspense accounts agewise.  The reference number is also provided for easy reconciliation.  Branches may make use of this utility to get the entries wiped off.<br>

The GLIF outstanding in the Cash and Transfer entries are available to the controllers for easy follow up with the branches.  It has been our observation, that on an average only 10-15 branches in the bank slip to GLIF. An early monitoring and asking the branch to rectify would yield results.  It has also been our experience that the branches give more attention to the directives from the Controllers than from CDC.</font><hr></td>

WSA:</font></td>
    <td width="425" height="118"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><div align="justify">

The following options are available under this head ;<br>
1.Clicking on WSA option gives the consolidated WSA of the Bank, Zone or Region. Clicking on the respective Code gives the total under the particular head again Bank, Zone or Region wise.<br>
2. Code wise listing : This basically is used to know the actual amounts under the asset or liability of a particular head.  For example, accounts like Current Account and Cash Credit can have both Credit and Debit balances and it is only the net that comes in the WSA.  This utility gives the gross of both. Under this clicking on ‘type’ will give the list of branches in descending order and clicking on the ‘code’ will give the list of branches in ascending order.<br>
3. Negative Balance Monitoring : The balances of accounts which are generally asset in nature should generally be in debit balance. Example is Stamp account, Cash Account which should never go to the credit balance.  Similarly example for a liability account is National and Local Clearing Items in Transit Account which should never go to debit balances.  Such of these accounts which are appearing on the other side is listed in this menu to enable the controllers to get the branch rectify the errors.<br>
4.Asset Liability Mismatch: The Asset Liability Mismatch also appears sometimes due to the above reason or for reasons like wrong accounting in FCNB/EEFC transactions.<br>
